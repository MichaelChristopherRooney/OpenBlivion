# OpenBlivion

OpenBlivion is an attempt to make an open-source implementation of the engine used by The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

## Implemented features:

Load and decompress data in .bsa archives.

Display .dds textures contained in the .bsa archives.

## In progress features:

Load and parse model data contained in .nif files within the .bsa archives

## Upcoming features:

Parse the cell data used by Oblivion to determine which textures/models/sounds to load.

Automatically load all .bsa files under the working directory.

## Other work to do:

Refactor the code to be less dependent on static classes and global variables.
